**Hangman Game - Python Project**

**Introduction**

This Python project implements a classic "Hangman" game where users try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and a .exe executable file for easy access.

**Features**

- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- User input for guessing letters.
- Visual representation of the hangman figure as the game progresses.
- Tracks incorrect guesses and remaining attempts.
- Displays the correctly guessed letters in their correct positions.
- Provides a GUI for interactive gameplay.

**New Feature: Now Includes Executable File!**

This project now includes an executable file (hangman_game.exe) for seamless use on Windows. Simply download and run hangman_game.exe to start playing immediately without the need for Python installation.

**Getting Started**

**Download the Executable:**

- Download hangman_game.exe from the repository.

**Run the Executable:**

- Double-click hangman_game.exe to launch the game.

**Gameplay**

The program will display a series of underscores representing the hidden word. As you guess letters, the program will either fill in the correct positions or add parts to the hangman figure if the guess is wrong.

**High Score**

The game tracks the number of incorrect guesses and encourages players to improve their performance by guessing the word with fewer mistakes.

**Further Development**

- **Word Categories:** Implement different word categories (e.g., Animals, Countries, Movies).
- **Difficulty Levels:** Allow users to select difficulty levels that affect the word length and number of allowed incorrect guesses.
- **Hint System:** Add a hint feature where users can request a clue at the cost of an additional incorrect guess.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Introduce a two-player mode where one player selects the word, and the other player tries to guess it.

**Example Interaction**

```
Welcome to Hangman! Guess the word: _ _ _ _ _
Enter a letter: e
Correct! The word now looks like: _ e _ _ e
Enter a letter: s
Incorrect! The hangman figure is starting to appear.
...
```

**Thanks for playing!**

This format provides a clear overview of the Hangman game with its new GUI and executable features, making it more accessible and enjoyable for users on Windows.
